<!--Accessibility considerations
Opening links in a new tab or window can cause accessibility issues. Here are some reasons why: Links opening in a new tab can prove disorienting for people with low vision or are navigating via screen reader, especially when there is no warning. However, using iframe to package content within a modal also raises accessibility concerns-->

        <p>We practiced our skills on Visual Studio Code to create a Get to Know Me website. We learned how to encode photos and text within the website. By using Github we created a published website with its own domain to see the results of our work. </p>

        <p>Using Adobe Logo Maker and Canva Logo we created three logos that represented us as a person. I wanted to create possible business logos as well while doing this project. For Adobe, we put in text and picked an icon, and/or style we wanted. You could then move objects around, change colors, or change the text. These were the first three drafts.</p>

     </a>
        <p>With the three logos drafted, we created a UX design study with three participants. I asked three types of questions: reflective, behavioral, and visceral. The answers we got from the participants helped us gather feedback about our logos. From my three participants' responses, I changed my logos drastically. I kept the elements that like enjoyed (color, font, spacing) but removed elements and replaced them. These were my final three logos that came from my UX design study.</p>

          </a>
              <p>Using layers for this cartoon portrait was vital. We used the eyedropper to color-match the shades on the photo we were cartooning. We then used the pen tool to mark out the spots we wanted to fill with said color. It was very easy to make mistakes throughout this process so much so I decided to scrap my progress multiple times. I found sometimes when the eyedropper wasn’t giving the color I wanted it was easy to change the shade to what you were looking for.</p>

              <p>By locating an example of a well-made design, we can dissect the elements to find components of good design. We used and learned how to use the arrange, frame, and text tools. We picked out elements within the design and applied them to design principles that we have learned throughout the class. </p>

           <p><em>1. Consider the role of rhetoric, technology, and ethics in acts of making.</em></p>
              <p>In my "Get to Know Me" website, I explored the role of technology by learning how to encode photos and text within Visual Studio Code and using Github to publish the site. I made deliberate decisions about what personal information to share and how to represent myself, which made me consider the ethical implications of digital self-presentation. For my logo designs, I examined how visual elements like colors, fonts, and icons conveyed a message about my identity and potential business ideas, emphasizing the importance of rhetoric in design. </p>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
            <p><em>2. Leverage Design Principles.</em></p>
              <p>I applied key design principles like color theory, balance, and spacing in my logo creation process. Through UX testing, I was able to refine these logos based on participant feedback, ensuring that my designs adhered to these principles in a way that resonated with users. In the cartoon portrait project, I used layering and color-matching techniques to achieve a more visually appealing result, applying what I’d learned about shading and composition to create a polished final piece.</p>

             <p><em>3. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
              <p> By conducting UX testing on my logos, I engaged with others in a workshop-like environment where their feedback was crucial to improving my work. I asked reflective, behavioral, and visceral questions to gather insights from participants, and their responses helped me understand how to refine my designs. This collaborative approach helped me see my work from different perspectives, which ultimately shaped the final versions of my logos. We also spend time reflecting on all projects in class. We present to our small group and compare and contrast other designs. </p>

              <p>I practiced revision throughout these projects, especially in my logo and cartoon portrait work. After receiving feedback from the UX study, I revised my logos by keeping the elements that participants liked and replacing those that didn’t resonate. Similarly, when creating my cartoon portrait, I repeatedly scrapped my work to make improvements, adjusting colors and shading to better match the effect I wanted to achieve. This iterative process helped me grow as a designer across different media.</p>

              <p>Publishing my "Get to Know Me" website on Github was a significant step in learning how to present my work professionally. It allowed me to showcase what I had built in a real-world context. Similarly, after refining my logos based on UX testing, I presented the final versions, gaining confidence in sharing my designs with others. These experiences taught me the importance of effectively presenting my projects to different audiences.</p>

        <p>
          For the magazine spread reproduction, I started by choosing a visually compelling two-page layout as my model. I created an 11x17” page in InDesign, using the color swatch and other tools to match the original design’s colors, fonts, and layout as closely as possible. I was able to ask AI to find a close match the font that was on the original. I used text fill to for it to write up some lorem ipsum words. The hardest part was finding an image without water marks or have it be blurry. I put the original inside of the one I created </p>

     </a>
        <p>In my design resume project, I focused on making a creative resume that would stand out for design roles. I tried out multiple different layouts or pieces to get ideas from and decided I needed to find one that I thought stuck out. I worked with InDesign’s text box controls, type-on-a-path, and text wrapping to create a unique layout that reflects my style while showcasing my skills and experience. I also created some not-real skills/jobs of things I do on a daily but don't actually do for work.</p>

    </a>
       <p>For the poster, I wrote about 50-100 words of engaging text and experimenting with layouts in InDesign. I focused on creating eye-catching visuals and strong typography to communicate the message effectively. I used the color palette tool and brought the poster to life. </p>

      <p>In the design consultation project, I collaborated with my manager from Lola’s Eatery to create merch designs for their upcoming launch. They gave me a few ideas and I created from there. I ended up making 5+ designs but I showed them the A/B samples for this project. I conducted a client meeting, developed a design brief, and presented A/B samples for feedback. After refining the design based on the client’s input, I delivered a final version that aligned with their goals. This project was a great way to step into the world of graphic design and getting paid to design.</p>

            <p><em>1. Consider the role of rhetoric, technology, and ethics in acts of making.</em></p>
               <p>In each project, I’m using design to convey a message—like how my resume presents me as a creative professional or how the ad communicates a product’s value. For the design consultation project, I need to think ethically about my client's needs, making sure my design truly reflects their goals and values while using technology to bring their vision to life.</p>

           <p>In the UX study presentation, I used rhetoric to frame participant insights and justify design choices, employed Google Slides as a technological platform, and prioritized ethics by accurately representing participant feedback and ensuring data transparency. Similarly, the accessible design project emphasized ethical considerations by incorporating inclusive design practices, such as high-contrast visuals and readable fonts, ensuring usability for diverse audiences. Reproducing the magazine spread combined rhetorical analysis of the original design’s intent with technological tools like InDesign to recreate its aesthetic elements. </p>
